Model-1-PhilipsHackabout.ipynb contains our initial "Bag of Words" model for round 1.
Round 1 problem statement was "SemEval-2010 Task 8: Multi-Way Classification
of Semantic Relations Between Pairs of Nominals."
Considering the nature of problem statement this model performed decently but was not accurate enough so we modified our approach and for our final submission we used a Convolutional Neural Network model with word embeddings based on this paper

The source code, of that, will be uploaded after the competition ends.
